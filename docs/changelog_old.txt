----------
Changed Energy/Metal balancing, for a less stall-prone gameplay.
Made Aircraft unable to Guard, so that exponential gameplay is slowed and impossible with Air (ala traditional OTA gameplay).
Wrote all new custom ExplosionGenerators for a lot of basic FX, including better smoke code and other improvements.
Built several new models, finished others, and cleaned up operations on many.
Added new flare FX for most units.
Rebalanced many SWTA units to fit more cleanly into the SWS overall gameplay.
Moved several items, including the Imperial Transport, to a lower Tech Level to promote their use, especially during early gameplay.
Rewrote the aircraft steering code for the vast majority of units that can fly.
Rewrote all Rebel weapons so that they fit the standards established during Imperial fix stage.
Rewrote all Rebel Units so that they fit the standards established during Imperial fix stage.
Outlined basic gameplan for the fix list, and established roadmap for future fixes.
Added reworked sounds by L0223R.  These still need fixes for occasional clipping issues.

-----------
Most units:
-Nemo added "NOTINF" category to all non-infantry category, and made that cat the REBCMNDO's badtargetcategory. Now he will prefer firing on infantry rather than wasting shots on other targets.

Jul 30 2006
-----------
Whole mod:
-Cleaned .fbi files, restructured categories

imp_d_AdvAA, imp_d_Artillery, imp_inf_EWEB, imp_d_IonCannon, imp_d_MissileTurret, imp_air_TIEBomber, imp_air_TIEFighter, imp_d_Turbolaser, rebaa, rebaaa, rebarty, reb_d_golan_turret, rebmrb:
-Fixed categories; category=DEFENSE; now except for the ties, which are VTOL

Jul 12 2006
-----------
Lasers:

Movement classes:
-Changed the following units from Walker3x3 to Walker2x2 (also adjusted footprints to match):
	imp_v_ATAR, imp_v_ATPT, REBATPT

-Changed Infantry1x1's crushstrength to 0.
-Tank2x2 maxwaterdepth to 10
-TANKHOVER2's maxslope to 15 (so heavier hovers can't climb steep hills--may need changed back)
-New movement class, TANKHOVER3 (name due to engine restrictions). Contains ConDs and other light hovers, which can go up steeper hills now:
	imp_c_ConDroid, reb_c_ConDroid, imp_sc_Bike, REBSWOOP, REBLAND, REBULAV, imp_sc_ProbeDroid

-----------
