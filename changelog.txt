----------
Balance:
 -Features (corpses/map props) now have reclaimtimes normalized for IW. This includes trees. Please comment on whether the current reclaim rate is too fast or slow.

 Visual:
 - trialling a new icon, based on the inf_light icon, for battledroids
 - New ZUI resource bars to replace the ugly old SWSUI bars. These resource bars are also placeholders, but are far closer to the end product, they've just been shrinked to accomodate the minimap (which later moves down to the bottom left corner).

  -laser is now a normal laser (with a long duration) and a fairly slow velocity to make it less effective against moving targets
 -Espo/ATRT LOS increased by 20%
 Technical:
 -Fixed a squad spawner logic bug
 -Fixed a minor error in combat selections widget

Build 044
----------
 Balance:
 - Fixed erroneous 10% SBD range boost received accidentally in 043
 - rebel trooper buildtime reduced 8->7
 - rebmrb range increased 420->460
 - rebwookie range reduced 375->325
 - reb commando squad BT reduced 128-15 (!)
 - imp protocon armour increased 120->180
 - bombers (both sides) BT reduced 10%
 - STAP BT reduced 22->18
 - probe droid and landspeeder have had their seismic detection increased (it was shorter then LOS...)
  - LOS decreased by a small amount
 - armour increase from the 'command' upgrade for rebel commander removed
 - assist removed from all rebel commander variants
  - New ability, "command" added to rebel commander upgrades
  - Military Command: Gives nearby troops a HP and reload boost (20% for both)
  - Econ Command: Gives nearby construction items (facs/cons) a 25% BP increase.
 - units inside bunkers now get a small range bonus and a small reload reduction
 - both the rebel and imperial airborne vehicle lifters will now heal their loaded vehicles quite quickly (for now it is free too)
 Technical:
 -Added Auto First Build Facing widget by zwzsg, which will set your default build facing based the closest map edge to your start position
 -Removed old deathwatch luarule gadget and replaced it with a new one written from scratch. This should hopefully solve the crashing issues the old one had
 -New luarule gadget aura.lua which provides various bonuses to units
 -Removed old hackish 10% range bonus to units in bunkers/pillboxes. They now use a simple aura.
 -These units will now turn and face their targets when they are in hold position and stationary:
  -Crab Droid
  -AT-RT
  -Hailfire
  -TX-130
  -Espo
 -Fixed broken moveclasses on T1-b, TX-130 for reals this time
 -Updated combat selections widget: it will now filter units within bunkers unless holding alt
 -Fixed ShieldState bug in tooltip widget
 Graphics:
 -Added aura icons to our healthbar widget. These icons are color coded and will show you what units are under the effect of an aura. The color codes are:
  -Red: weapon stats (range and reload time)
  -Green: health stats (armor increase and healing)
  -Yellow: Buildpower
  -Blue: Resource generation (nothing uses this right now)
  -Currently this does not differenciate between buffs and debuffs caused by auras, but there aren't any debuffs right now so we'll cross that road if we come to it

Build 043
----------
*** this is mostly a bugfix build, with some minor balance changes.
 Balance:
 - both bombers now drop their bombs ~1.5 times what they were before. This means that they can hit moving targets more effectively. (they still struggle to hit fast things, but can hit infantry far better)
 - rebel troopers now move just under 5% faster
 - wookies now move just under ~5% slower
  - BT increased 13-15
 - all factories maxslope tolerance increased 15->20. You are now allowed to build them on more uneven ground.
 - ewebs/mrb's will no longer attempt to fire at most air units.
  - They will still attempt to fire (and thus deploy) at bikes, gunships and transports.
** if you are trying to get them to flee from bikes/gunships and don't want them to deploy, we recommend switching them to hold fire
 - bikes can no longer fire on air units. They will still fire at other bikes.
 -Fixed exploit in Rebel mobile generator (you could get full resource income while it was moving by issuing commands in a specific order)
 Technical:
 - Flags spawned after an upgrade is destroyed will hopefully no longer be decapped by your troops, causing instability.
 -Added toggles.lua gadget by KDR (from THIS) for use on the Rebel mobile energy generator.
  -The generator can now move in hold position (fixing that "bug") and has a new "Park" command which functions like a normal on/off switch
 Visual:
 - The icon system has been reworked.
  - There is now a new class of unit, the "medium" class.
  - The symbol that represented 'light' has not changed, but you will find that now less units are using it.
  - The symbol that represented 'heavy' now represents 'medium'.
  - The symbol that represented 'Special' now represents 'Heavy'.
  - A new symbol has been added for the 'special' unit class, using the aurebesh character Aurek.
  - See the forums for a visual explanation, which will make much more sense, as well a list of which units have changed, and what their new icon designations are.

Build 042v3
----------
 Balance:
 -Reduced Garrison command upgrade resource production: 10 -> 7.5 and 800 -> 500
 Technical:
 -(Theoretically) fixed the problem targetting repulsorlift units. If there are still issues we may need to switch to raytracing

Build 042v2
----------
Balance:
 - droideka footprint doubled in order to prevent them from being bunched up so that their shields overlap.
 - imp antiair weapon velocity quadrupled. Should be able to hit fighters better now. We'll probably have to change this thing's weapon in the future.
 - imp tiefighter armour reduced by 10%
 Technical:
 - Hopefully ewebs won't lockup now.

Build 042
----------
 Balance:
 - All units except for infantry have had their hitboxes revised. You can hit 'b' while ingame to review their changes. This means that unit's hitboxes now match their actual visual shape far more closely. In some instances, this will make units harder to hit then before, in most instances, easier - aircraft in particular.
 - replaced the rocket trooper in the ASSAULT squad with a regular stormtrooper. Repriced accordingly.
 - eweb removed from the HEAVY squad. Repriced accordingly.
 - 3 anti air units removed from the DEFENSE squad. Replaced with 1 eweb and 1 repeater. Priced accordingly.
 - new squad - ANTIAIR - 5XAA trooper, 1XStormtrooper
  - cost: 280M, 1200E, 32BT
  - Note: Stormtrooper is free
 - imperial rocket trooper price reduction: M:25%, E:25%, BT:15%. This was considered in the AA squad.
 - turnrate of handheld rocket weapons (both) increased - can hit more nimble craft now
  - weapon velocity increased
 ** remember that aircraft hitboxes are now typically much larger, and so are easier to hit too.
 - increased the accuracy and weapon velocity of the imperial static anti air
 - flamer health increased 15%
  - flamer speed increased 10%
  - flamer weapon AOE increased 64->96
 - reb commando squad Mcost increased 50%, Ecost increased 50%. BT unchanged.
 - rebbothan Mcost increased 100->125, Ecost increased 300->400. Bt unchanged
 - pillbox BT reduced 26->13
 - the range boost of the eweb while inside a pillbox had to be reverted as it was causing ewebs to lock-up. We will put this back in once we solve the problem.

 Technical:
 -New "ZUI" tooltip widget. This one will automatically scale according to your resolution. This is the first step in a total ZUI replacement.
 -Tweaked tooltips in following luarules to be more compatible with new tooltip widget:
  -upgrade_manager
  -area_attack
  -unit_saboteur
  -capture_command
 -New Build/orders menu resizing widget. Now seperate from the tooltip, and will also scale to resolution and will never overlap with the minimap
 -New minimap scaling widget. This will make the minimap always obey a defined maximum dimension (height or width, depending on the map's aspect ratio) and will retain map AR
 -Updated healthbar widget to have a better outlining algorithm
 -New luarule gadget, hq_heading.lua. It sets the heading of the Imperial HQ based on nearest map edge
 -Made upgrade_manager compatible with hq_heading
 -hq_guard_manager: removed useless 'Recall' command
 Graphics:
 - scout troopers now have the infantry_scout icon type.

 * The following vehecular and walker units have had their turninplace ability turned off now that this can be in 077. This stops units from moving, stopping, turning to face their next move order, then moving again. They will rather arc towards their target while maintaining their speed. Units will still turn on the spot when they are motionless and given a move order behind them.
  - Imperial APC, Droideka, Hailfire, mobile arty, tiecrawler, imptx130, ATRT, reb hover transport, reb landspeeder, rebt2b, rebt1b.

Build 040v3
----------
 Technical:
 -New capture command, coded by KDR_11k:
  -Units with the ability to capture now have a "Capture Flag" command in their menus
  -Use the associated widget in order to click near flags to issue a capture command by default (the cursor will change)
  -The command is properly queue-able

 - imp scoutbike buildtime reduced ~13%
 - reb swoopbike BT reduced ~8%
 - imp ASSAULT squad BT reduced ~5%
 - rebshuttle BT + Ecost increased 10%
  - metalcost increased 20% (200-240M, still very cheap)

Build 039
----------
Large Balance Changes:
 ***Important Resource Rebalance:
 - Military upgrades now make 1.5 times what a standard flag point makes.
  - They no longer have their significant energy upkeep costs (they still draw -15 each)
  - they have had their buildtimes reduced by 10% each
 - Economic Upgrades now have an upkeep half of what they currently do
  - their initial energy cost for production is now doubled what it was previously
  - their buildtimes have been increased by 25%
  - they now have larger death explosions
 ***Important Infantry Balance:
 - All infantry weapon damages have been reduced by 20%. This on top of any changes mentioned below.
  - This includes all infantry droids, including the droideka.
  - this does NOT include: Crab Droid, Royal Guard, both infantry-level walkers, the rebel AV rocket commando, 
 ***New unit: Imperial Pillbox
 - Small bunker which holds four regular troopers, or one eweb trooper, built by protoconstruction droids. It does not come pre-loaded!
  - Armour: 1200 Metal: 300  Energy: 1000 BT: 26
  - units inside the bunker when it dies are lost.
  - I expect this unit will not be immediately balanced first off, please be patient and give it a go.
 Other Balance Changes:
 -Infantry in bunkers (particularly ewebs) can no longer be sniped while within the bunker
 -Construction droid is now built from the droid lab
 - imp scout trooper weapon damage increased 25%
  - range reduced 270->240
 - rebcommander (unupgraded) health reduced 4000->3000
  - no change to other commanders. The 'command' upgrade therefore gives an extra 1200 health.
 - reb commando squad changes:
  - Cost reduced across the board by 20% - M, E and BT
  - veteran health reduced 290->260
  - veteran reload increased 1.3->1.5
  - sniper reload time increased 20% to 6.6

  - bothan takes longer to set up a charge (5s), and deals much less damage (5000->2000).
 - swoop/speederbike weapon damage increased 10%
 - hailfire acceleration reduced by 20%
 - golan m/e cost reduced 25%. BT unchanged.
 - weapon damage reduced 150->110
 - weapon reload decreased 2.6->2.3
 - rebel fusion Mcost increased by 10%
 - droideka damage increased 10%
  - droideka shield regen reduced by 20%. This is to offset potential OP via the mod-wide infantry nerf

  - M, E & BT increased by 10%
 - wookie Mcost increaased 10%
 - energy storages hold 20% more E
 - military upgrade can now hold 6 infantry, or two ewebs (or one eweb and four infantry!)
  - a reminder that aa troops cannot fire out of bunkers
 - all combat air units LOS increased by approximately 1/4
 - air scout LOS increased 50%

 Technical:
 -Sped up all widgets
 -Updated healthbar widget. Bars now scale with unit distance from camera, and are hidden unless:

  -The unit is damaged (shields or hp)
  -The unit is building or upgrading
  -The unit is transporting
 -Upgrade manager gadget and sell manager gadget updated to support buildpics
 -Units with custom commands (upgrade, etc) now receive those commands in UnitCreated instead of UnitFinished
 -Merged the AI call-in to flag_manager for basic KAIK support. I forgot to do this several builds ago
 -Combat selections widget: Shift-selecting one unit at a time will always add the unit to the current group even if alt is not pressed. Shift-selecting a group still requires the shift+alt combo to select all unarmed units as well.
 -Hold position widget no longer makes aircraft hold position by default. This is because they won't acquire ground targets in LOS in hold position
 Graphics:
 -New Imperial Pillbox model by Gnome, skin by Zsinj
 -Buildpics for upgrades, selling, and other custom lua commands
        Build 038v3
 -Improved droideka script:
  -Doesn't deploy when given new orders/when reaching a waypoint if there's nothing to fire at
  -Can now fire without needing to roll first
  -Rolling animation sped up (the unit's actual speed is the same)
  -More reliable deploying, stays deployed more reliably when in combat
  -Uses Turninplace=0 (will not take effect until next engine version)
 -Also added turninplace to imp ground transport, hailfire, AT-RT and Espo. Will not take effect until next engine release
        Build 038v2
 -Fixed broken droid weapons

Build 038
----------
 Balance:
 -Fake mex script for Military flag upgrades fixed by TheFatController. Mil upgrades now produce 2x an upgraded flag does on the same spot in all cases.
 -Repair speeds are now 2x greater than a unit's base workertime. Shut up, Ivory
 -Gave imp/reb commander units proper buildtimes (proportional to their health, based on the T1-b's proportions) so they repair in proper time spans
 -Crab droid now has an armor class
 -Rebel MRB can now fire through features (trees, wreckage, etc) like most other things
 -Super battle droid damage nerfed 40 -> 32 per bolt

 -Rebel veteran trooper damage nerfed 50 -> 40 per bolt
 Technical:
 -Added canhover=1 to protocon droid to suppress error message in infolog.txt
 -Hold position by default is now a widget instead of a gadget. This just means that it's optional now.
 -Squad spawner bugs fixed (for real this time):
  -Squads now properly inherit move/firestate orders from their factory
  -Fixed technical problem where squad-building factories spawned at the exact same game frame would get the fake squad unit stuck in their yard
  -Individuals within a factory-built squad will now spawn facing the same heading as their parent factory
  -.give/.give all bug fixed (thanks Flozi)
 -Many luarule speedups and enhancements by TheFatController
 -Dropships are now proper units

  -Bothan stealing: blue line
 -Healthbar widget now has build progress for builders. It shows as a red bar above the builder's own healthbar.
 - healthbar should not clip under the ground as much now.

Build 034
----------
 Balance
 - Imperial commander upgrade path changed.
  - Garrison Upgrade now comes before the radar upgrade
  - Garrison costs exactly the same as the barracks, takes longer to upgrade then to build though
  - eweb upgrade cost reduced: 420m, 1500e, 60 BT
  - reduced energy cost of radar upgrade 12k->10k
  - radar upgrade range boosted 3500->4750. That covers an 8*8 map entirely.
  - sonar on radar comm now equals radar range. 
 - reb landspeeder LOS boosted to 950
  - radar range boosted to 1200
 - New unit: Imperial Crab Droid
  - Intended to be a light vehicle accessed from the droid lab, a little weaker then the ULAV. Excellent for heavy infantry support
  - can climb walls!
  - costs: m=350, e=4000, BT=45
  - energy use 25(!)
  - NOTE: Has not been tested in multiplayer yet, so be wary of its balance, it may be off.

 - standardised ulav damages
 - Reb Vwing LOS boosted 400->550
 - imp probe droid los boosted 700->850
  - radar boosted to 1050

 - reb golan and imperial military flag upgrade can now no longer fire at air. This is a stop-gap solution until we can find a solution that makes them still able to fire at air units but unable to fire at 
 - reb mrb
  - burst reduced 20->18
 - rebcomm armour upgrade BT increased 40->75
  - mcost increased 30%
  - ecost increased 30%
 - rebcomm builder upgrade BT increased 60->65;

  - Therefore, the builder upgrade boosts to 4000 armour, and the armour upgrade boosts to 10,000 armour
 - rebcomm side weapons boosted in power
  - rebcomm forward repeater nerfed considerably
  - Note: This was done to give the commander more damage in a 360 arc around it, instead of before when it was very forward-oriented in power. It should now be able to retreat more safely now.

Build 033 (early)
----------
 Technical:
 -Revised Imperial Commander model and scripts so its ghost mode looks a little nicer (though still not indicative
  of upgrades)
 -Fixed imp/reb wall icontypes
 -Added new healthbar widget. It's disabled by default so it won't conflict with jK's one until we eventually use
  the thing to lock out external widgets.
 -Renamed resbar widget, and renamed all three packaged widgets in the F11 list to be named "IW/whatever" rather
  than "SWS/"
 Balance:
 -Rebel commanders now have an upgrade system:
  -The initial rebel commander starts out with 2000 armor, otherwise unchanged
  -Upgrade option #1 gives the commander 5000 armor for more offensively minded people
   - Metal Cost: 650, Energy Cost: 1400, Buildtime: 40. Approximately equivalent to a barracks in price
  -Upgrade option #2 gives the commander a 50% buildpower increase and access to the Construction Droid's buildmenu
   - Metal Cost: 200, Energy Cost: 1250, Buildtime: 50. Slightly more expensive then a construction droid.
  -The upgrades are mutually exclusive, though a player can downgrade and choose the other option. Players receive
   no refund of any sort for downgrading.
  - The Imperial commander can now also downgrade
 - Imperial Hailfire can now only fire forward.
 - Imp Stormtrooper special damages removed. Deals 30 to all (tiny boost vs vehicles)
 - Imp reptrooper special damages removed. Deals 15 to all (tiny boost vs vehicles)
 - Imp royal guard special damages removed. Deals 70 to all (boost vs vehicles, weaker vs infantry)
 - Imp Scouttrooper special damages removed. Deals 10 to all (tiny boost vs vehicles)

  - armour boosted 315->580
 - Impcomm royal guard respawn rate 2->10
 - impcomm armour reduced 250->220
 - reb T2b weapon damage boosted 20->25
 - reb t2b weapon given a spray angle, it now fires it's weapon over an area, meaning it is more likely to hit a
   wider group of units, but less likely to hit an individual infantry target
  - weapon now has a burstrate of 2 -> it fires twice as fast as before
 - imp tiecrawler reload time reduced 0.45->0.35
 - reb static antiair can no longer attack ground
 - imp ATRT's weapon now has a 180-degree fire arc.
  - turnrate boosted 500->600

 - reb t2b's lasers made smaller to reflect their weakness
 - imp tiecrawler's laser made slightly smaller
 - reb static antiair given a new laser effect
        Build 032v2
 Technical
 - Flags should no longer cause problems during teamgames
 - units billowing smoke (as part of their anim - ie: imp flag econ upgrade, or damaged units) no longer show through fog.
 Balance

  - tx130's main weapon increased damage by 25%
 - rebel t1b tank 'ghost' second projectile removed
  - t1b main cannon damage increased by 30%
 - golan and imperial bunker weapons have had their turret rates reduced - 25% side-to-side, 50% up-and-down. This will mean that they shouldn't be able to shoot down aircraft anymore, unless those aircraft are hovering right in front of them (ie: a laat dropping off troops). This may reduce their effectiveness vs ground troops somewhat, especially when attacked from multiple angles.
 - imp tieb AOE increased 90->128
  - imptieb bomb damage increased by 20%
 - reb y-wing AOE decreased 100->96
  - y-wing bomb damage increased by 30%

Build 032
----------
 Technical
 - You now must 'neutralize' an enemy flag before you can capture it. 
 - neutral flags have a LOS of 0
 - small divide custom metal distribution fixed
 - flags are now no longer slightly damaged when captured
 Balance
 - This is how metal production works now:
  - Standard flag produces 1* extraction
  - military upgrade produces 2* extraction rate
  - econ upgrade produces 3* extraction rate.
   - NOTE: For this build, until we solve a bug, the military upgrade rate has been faked using 'metal make', which is set as a constant 2.8 metal per tick.
 - econ upgrades (both sides) have had their buildtimes increased by 20%
 - neutral flag health bumped 100->300
  - it now takes three times as long to capture a NEUTRAL flag point. This is relative to all units.
  - Combined with the note under 'technical', this means it takes four times as long to capture an enemy flag, though you would have removed it from the enemy's control in the same speed as you are in Build 031.
 - The Rebel commander captures points 5X faster then anything else. Effectively it captures at the speed of 5 infantrymen.
 - scout trooper buildtime reduced 8->7
 - buildings will now wait longer before decaying, and decay slower.
 - flag capture radius boosted 125->160
 - unupgraded flags now have a LOS equivalent to their capture range.

  - tiecrawler, tx130, t1b, t2b
 - reb ground transport weapon range 325->400
 - rebt2b(antiinf) range boosted 475->525
 - rebt1b range boosted 525->560
 - rebulav range at 400, stun weapon included
 - imptiec range boosted 300->375

  - metal cost reduced 3140->1500 (a barracks is only 900 or so)
  - energy cost reduced 7054->3000
 - impcomm resource upgrade rebalance: 
  - metalcost = 2500
  - energy cost 12000
  - buildtime 150

 Visual
 - the following infantry units have been given the 'heavy infantry' icon:
  - super battledroid

   - have NOT put it on the wookie. Should I?
 - hailfire and mobile artillery given the 'special vehicle' icon
 - flag upgrades have new radar icons. The icons are designed to allow for future upgrades to use the same system logic


Build 031
----------
 Balance
 - imp hailfire rebalance:
  - armour reduced 500->300
  - acceleration halved, 0.2->0.1
  - turn rate lowered to 300;
  - area of effect reduced 128->112
 - reduced range of rebelAA 900->700
  - increased buildtime 20->21
  - increased metal cost 500->550
 - reduced range of impAA 1100->900
 - increased build time 13->18
  - increased metal cost 400->500
 - Imp Fusion rebalance:
  - metal cost 100->200
  - energy cost 700->1200
  - Build time 16->24
  - energy make 35->100
  - no longer act as a storage. Used to store 100e
 SUMMARY: imp fusions are now a lot more cost effective, and they also produce a lot more energy then before (at a greater price). Their armour hasn't changed, so while they are economically the best choice, militarily they are not.
 - Reb Fusion rebalance:
  - no longer act as a storage. They used to store 200e.
  - metal cost 100->125
  - energy cost 700->800
  - build time 14->17
  - energy production 35->65
 - rebvarenergy rebalance:
  - metal cost increased 50->75
  - energy cost 500->600
  - buildtime 9->12
 
 - impsolar windproduction reduced 30->20. Base value (10) unchanged.
 - ALL energy production unit metal cost increased by 25%. This is on top of the above changes.
 - reb energy storage mcost reduced 550->400
  - energy cost increased 600-900
 - imp energy storage mcost reduced 
  - energy ecost reduced 2500->700
  - energy storage reduced 3000->2500

 - imp probot radar distance increased 700->900
  - LOS increased 500->700
 - reb landspeeder
  - metal cost 50->100
  - energy cost 500->600
  - buildtime reduced 23->16
  - radar distance increased to 1100
 - imp sensor radar distance 1500->1700
 - reb radar distance increased 1200->1600
 - LAAT death explosion reduced
 - protoncon health 80->40
 - econ flag upgrade rebalancing, both sides:
  - metal cost reduced by 60%
  - energy cost reduced by 50%
  - build time reduced by 50%
  - production reduced by 50% (4 for imps, 3.8 for rebs)
  - energy use reduced by 50%
  - armour reduced by 50%
  - SUMMARY: econ upgrade is now half as effective and half as expensive. Build them earlier, build more of them.
 - Both military upgrades now produce 2 metal apiece.
 - Both military upgrades now use 50 energy apiece. This is not on/offable.
 - LOS for both scoutbikes increased from 400->650
 - impscout buildtime reduced by 20% (reflected in scout squad BT)
 - rebscout buildtime reduced by 30% (it was unusually high)
 - tx130 rebalance:
  - metal cost increased 25%
  - energy cost increased 20%
  - build time increased 20%
  - armour increased 30%
  - removed energy make (it produced 2)
  - increased energy use to 10 (it used to use 2)
  - deals 300 damage per shot, irrespective of what it is firing at (used to deliver between 200-250, depending on target)
  - increased area of effect 8->16.
  - reload time increased 5->6
  - range increased 400->450
 - t2b rebalance (this one is the one with a fast repeating suppressive fire weapon)
  - armour reduced 1092->750
  - metal cost increased 400->600
  - turn rate increased 240->300
  - t2b damage levelled at 20
  - weapon range reduced 600(!)->450 [stormtrooper range at 350]
  - weapon reload reduced 0.75->0.35
  - removed energy make [was 2]
  - increased energy use to 8
  - build time increased 56->64
  - SUMMARY: The T2b should be a good suppression fire unit that is best used firing at large groups of infantry. It's laser is fast firing but not especially strong.
 - t1b rebalance (this is the anti-armour one)
  - armour increased to 1200
  - energy increased to 6500
  - buildtime increased to 84
  - energy make removed [was 2]
  - energy use increased to 12 from 2
  - reb t1b now has it's own weapon, it used to share that of the t2b (but with half the barrels)
   - damage set at 240 for everything
   - area of effect size at 16
   - reload at 4.5
   - range set at 475
   - [visual] made the weapon fatter and longer then the t2b's laser to make it appear more powerful
  - SUMMARY: The t1b is better in an anti-armour role. It's laser is high damage but slow firing, meaning that it will overkill infantry unnecessarily, but is very effective against tanks and buildings.
 - reb vwing build time increased 39->45
 - reb airspeeder and imp cloudcar metal cost increased 75->110
  - buildtime increased 16-19
  - energy cost increased 1500->2000
  - speed increased 4.8->5.1
 
 - energy make removed from the following units:
  - airspeeder, energy use now at 15
  - awing, energy use now at 25
  - rebshuttle, energy use now at 15
  - reb vehicle transport, energy use now at 25
  - Ywing now uses 25 energy
  - Twing, energy use now 5
  - Vwing, energy use now 20
  - z95, energy use now 15
  - TIEF, energy use now 12
  - tie/dr, energy use now 5
  - tie/b, energy use now 25
  - laat/c, energy use now 20
  - laat/i, energy use now 25
  - NOTE that aircraft do not use any energy when they have landed, only while in-flight.
  - SUMMARY: This is part of a process to make energy more important in the game. You now need to invest in more energy if you want to field a large air force. Note that earlier in this changelog repulsorlifts also received similar energy penalties. This also returns an advantage to infantry who need no energy to operate.
 - TIE/dr and T-wing are now unarmed. Remember that they both have good LOS and a radar. Your dogfighters will perform better with a few of them mixed in.
  - both have had 'unarmed' added to their description to avoid confusion.
 Visual
 - Flag decal removed. It has been replaced by a lua-drawn circle that indicates flag capture radius.
 - tx130's laser made fatter and longer to represent high damage
 - golan's laser made much fatter and longer to represent high damage & splash

Build 030 v2
----------
 Zsinj sucks

 -Fixed buildings being buildable underwater
        Build 029
 Balance:
 -Both economic flag upgrades are on/offable. They emit smoke to indicate on/off status for now

 Technical:
 -Fixed Imperial fusion crash bug once and for all
 -Updated flag handling stuff by lurker. They properly die and stuff now.
 -Fixed minor rebel economic flag upgrade script bug

Build 028.1
----------
 Balance:
 - Z95 magpulse range increased to 550. I think this was causing it to try to fly very close in order to fire. Now just a little shorter then laser range.

 - z95 weapon reload reduced by 30%
 - z95 armour reduced 270->220
 - z95 speed nerfed back to 5.5
 - tieb laser boosted to 20 (from 15). It no longer has any special damages.
 - removed a-wings damage modifier (it was 0.55) o_O

 - increased y-wing laser reload time 0.7->1
 - TIEF armour increased 108->120
 - TIEF laser reload time increased 0.6->0.7
 - awing speed reduced to 10.2 from 11

 - espo reload time reduced 0.7->0.4
 - eweb and mrb range swapped. eweb now 500 range, mrb now 450.
 - TIE crawler acceleration doubled. This is to fix the brakerate, which is accel*3. Can be reduced and properly fixed in next engine version
 Graphics:
 -New muzzleflash CEGs for Rebel Antiair turret, Espo; based on S44 MG42 muzzleflash

Build 028
----------
 Technical: [G]
 -Fixed atrt death cob error

 -Added new corpses for:
  -Imperial Solar panel
  -Imperial sensor tower
  -Rebel T1-b
  -Rebel T2-b
  -Rebel antiair turret
  -Rebel repulsorlift plant
 Balance:
 - Wookie rebalanced [Z]
  - cost increased to 100m (50) 400e (200)  --> this is prior to a later general cost reduction
  - health increased to 320 (150)
  - Weapon damaged increased by 25%
  - weapon reload reduced to 2.2 (2.3)
 - The following units can now capture flags: [Z]
  - Flametrooper, eweb, mrb, both hand-held anti air units
 - hand-held anti air (both sides) can no longer force fire at the ground [Z]
 - T-wing can now fire on ground units. However, it will still prefer air units to ground units if it has a choice. [Z]
 - all _b_ and _p_ units (both sides) have had maxslopes increased to 15 (10). Droids will be less discerning on how flat the ground is before allowing you to build. Golan raised to 18 from 14. [Z]
 - Hailfire rebalanced: [Z]
  - armour boosted to 500 (225), now the same as a Super Battle Droid.
  - break rate doubled (0.1->0.2)
  - range boosted to 650 (550)
  - missiles are now more inaccurate (wobble 4000->5000)
  - missiles deal more damage (80->90)
  - metal cost increased (450->500)
  - energy cost increased (3700->4200)
 - Espo Rebalanced: [Z]
  - health increased (400->570)
  - metal cost increased to 300 (200)
  - energy cost increased to 2700 (2500)
  - sight distance increased to 450 (400)
 - ATRT rebalanced: [Z]
  - health increased (430->500)
  - metal cost increased to 300 (250)
  - energy cost reduced to 2500 (2700)
  - buildtime reduced to 33
 - Both ATRT and Espo (they share a weapon file)
  - reload time reduced to 0.7 (0.8)
  - Damage increased by 15%
  - SUMMARY: Espo is now slower but better armoured then the ATRT. ATRT is faster and more nimble. They now cost roughly similar to each other. They are both more powerful and better armoured.
 - Imp_d_antiair rebalanced
  - sight increased 400->450
  - metal cost decreased 500->400
  - Range reduced to 1100 (1200)
 - reb_d_antiair rebalanced
  - sight increased 400->450
  - metal cost increased 400->500
  - range increased to 700->900
 - reb + imp static antiair damages swapped. Imperial damage weakened, rebel damage boosted (16 v 22 average)
  - SUMMARY: Imperial AA has more range but less damage. It is also cheaper Good for protecting wider areas. Rebel AA has less range but more damage, and is more expensive. Good for protecting key targets.
 - laat/i rebalance
  - beamlaser damage halved
  - chinlaser damage reduced by around 35%
 - infantry cost rebalance:
  - All barracks-based infantry have had their M cost reduced by 10%   ---> for wookies, this is reduced from the prior increase of 100m. This has been reflected in squad pricing.
  - This excludes the rebel trooper and the normal (not rep) stormtrooper, who have had their M costs reduced by 20%
  - This excludes the bothan, who has had no change.
  - This excludes the flamer, who has had it's M cost increased to 70. It was originally at 50.
   - artificially increased the price of the heavy squad by 10% on top of what was worked out. There appeared to have been some sort of tweaking going on that only changed squad prices, and my intuition tells me the price I've arrived at is too low.
 - Imperial Barracks armour boosted 1100->1300
 - Rebel Barracks armour boosted 1000->1200
  - Rebel barracks cost reduced from 700 to 650. Now the same as the Imperial Barracks.
  - Rebel barracks buildtime reduced from 33 to 32. Now the same as the Imperial Barracks.
 - Droid Rebalance:
  - Battledroid metal cost reduced by half to 25 (from 50), energy increased 200->300
  - Droideka metal cost reduced 350->300
  - droideka armour increased 100->130
  - droideka energy use rasied to 9 (6)
  - Super Battle Droid energy use raised to 13 (10)
 - Imp Scout trooper rebalance:
  - LOS increased to 700 from 500 (500 = current stormtrooper LOS)
  - metal cost reduced to 30 from 50
  - Build time increased from 5 to 8
 - Rebel Commander Rebalance:
  - 25% armour increase (4000->5000)
  - decreased firepower by 15%
  - increased reload time by ~10% (3.5->3.9)
 - Imperial military flag upgrade armour boosted 1240->1500 (~20%)
  - Weapon reload time reduced from 1.4 to 1.2
 - Rebel Military flag upgrade armour boosted 1473->1700 (~20%)
 - Rebel Golan turret rebalance:
  - Armour reduced 1000 to 900
  - reload time increased 2->2.6
 - condroids can no longer assist. The rebel commander can still assist. Is this unintuitive or unfair? I thought it would give extra importance to the rebel comm - especially to players who want to keep the comm safely back at base.
 - Imp Airlab Rebalancing:
  - Metal and energy cost increased by 50% M=1500 (1000), E=3000 (2000)
  - Buildtime increased by 25% (34-43)
 - Reb Airlab rebalancing:
  - Metal and energy cost increased by 40% M=1400 (1000), E=2940 (2100)
 - air rebalancing:
 - V-wing description renamed to 'atmospheric gunship' to avoid confusion
 - V-wing metal cost increased 200->250
 - Y-wing bomb power increased by 50% (330-500)
 - TIEB bomb power increased by 50%
  - armour changes
   - TIEB/Y-wing armour reduced by 50%
   - all ground-air weapon damage reduced by 50%
   - z95: armour reduced 25%
   - laat: armour reduced 25%
   - laat/c: armour reduced 25%
   - tie/d: armour reduced 20%
   - TIE/F: armour reduced by 40%
   - t-wing: armour reduced by 20%
   - v-wing: armour reduced by 25%
   - airspeeder/cloudcar: reduced by 25%
  - weapon changes:
   - scout-50% less power
   - TIEF: 50% less power
   - TIEI: 25% less power
   - TIEB: 50% less power
   - Y-wing laser: 50% less power
   - T-wing: 50% less power
   - z95 laser: 25% less power
   - a wing, missile and laser: 25% less power
   - Z95 magpulse damages adjusted: deals 800 vs all vehicles [light armour - up from 400, heavy armour - down from 1200]
   - z95 laser range increased to 580 - now same as TIEF
  -z95 speed increased from 5.4 to 5.7
  -TIEF speed increased from 6.0 to 6.1
  -tie/i & a-wing speed increased from 10.8 to 11
   - SUMMARY: lasers are now half as effective vs ground. Armour has been rejigged to keep aircraft similar against each other. Variations in armour changes and power changes account for relative 'boosts' in those areas. Interceptors are now relatively more powerful, and fighters are now relatively weaker then they were before.
 - All combat aircraft have had a cost increase of 30% - metal and energy. Any cost changes after this note are after this change.
  - airspeeder and cloudcar not included, V-wing not included, though it has already has a price rise as indicated in an earlier note. Scouts included.
 - All aircraft have had their build times increased by 10%
  - this does not include speeder bikes, the STAP or the Rebel Shuttle. 
  - tie/i and awing increased m/e cost a further 25% on all prior mentioned increases.
        Build 027
 Tehnical:
 -'Fixed' automatic flag spawner breaking on tall maps. Probably not the most efficient way but it only runs once a game anyway
 -Resized AT-RT and Speederbikes so the scout troopers on them match foot troop scale. Didn't scale the trooper on the rebel speederbike.
 -Added new corpses for:
  -Imperial fusion
  -Imperial ground transport
  -Imperial AT-RT
  -Imperial construction droid
  -Imperial TX-130
  -Imperial Probe droid
  -Imperial e-web
  -Rebel Commander
  -Rebel mobile generator
  -Rebel Landspeeder

Build 026
----------
 Balance:
 -Reb commander's blue lasers can fire through features now [G]
 -Imperial Guard health raised to 200 from 250. This is an attempt to prevent a rebel comm rush at the outset of the game, as well as make the Commander a harder target.  [Z]
 -TIE Droid given LOS of 400 and radar of 800. This brings it into line with the T-wing. [Z]
 -increased LOS, Radar, Sonar given by Impcomm radar upgrade (700, 3000, 2500 respectively)
 -Imp Commander upgrade costs reduced by 25% for metal and energy. Time unchanged. Final upgrades for each route (walls and resources1) did not have their costs changed. This is to encourage commander upgrade usage. [Z]
 -Halved cost (M, E, BT) of economic flag upgrades for both sides [Z].
  -Halved health of both
  -Halved output, rounding up where necessary. energy cost factored appropriately where rounding up occurs. [Z]
  --Decided to raise rebel metal output to 7, though technically half of its original output was 6. This is to reduce potential disparity between imp and reb output, which could create a huge advantage for the imperials on a mid-large sized map. This change will need to be reviewed. [Z]
 -Halved armour of all aircraft [Z]
  - This includes transports. Lets see how they fare when fired upon by ground units before considering if this needs to be raised. [Z]
  -This includes speeder bikes and stap [Z]s
 -Halved damage of all aircraft weapons. This includes speederbikes. They weren't too problematic in previous games; but to leave them where they were would mean they were almost as powerful as TIEF lasers! [Z]
  -reduced laat damage (beam and weapons) by 60%, not 50% like other aircraft. [Z]
  -Bombs and magpulse not touched. [Z]
 -Halved damage of all anti-air weapons: rocket troopers (both sides), defensive emplacements (both sides).[Z]
 -increased laat cost (M, E, BT) by 20% [Z]
 -Rebel Espo: 230-->400 armor, 150-->200 metal cost
 -Speeder bikes: velocity nerf 7-->5 imp, 6.5-->4.5 rebel
 -STAP: velocity nerf 6-->4
 -L1 fusion generators: metal cost 150-->100 to hopefully encourage their use
 -Super battle droids no longer stop to fire. They receive a 40% speed decrease, however
 Technical:
 -Fixed (hopefully) imp fusion crash bug  [G]
 -Fixed flag teamkilling thanks to lurker's eagle eyes   [G]
 -Flags now respawn as neutral if a player is eliminated in a game with more than two players (thanks lurker)  [G]
 -Fixed a few missing texture errors  [G]
 -Removed rebel advanced barracks unitdef. Probably would have caused a crash bug eventually if someone tried a .give all
 -Edited rebel barracks yardmap, it should better allow espos to exit
 -Fixed royal guard jitter bug and gave them idle anims
 Graphics:
 -New imp commander ground decal by Zsinj  [Z]
        Build 025
 Balance:
 -Rebel commander can now capture flags
 -Imperial mobile artillery is now more inaccurate
 Technical:
 -Fixed flag capture spawner spawning wrong flag for imperials
 -Fixed a couple missing tatex errors (work on the corpses zsinj)
 -Killed rattle for changing how set ACTIVATION works ('fixed' reb_p_varenergy for now)
 -TIE/c tracks fade out faster now
 Graphics:
 -New flag ground decal by Zsinj

Build 024
----------
 Balance:
 -Neutral flags show up in ghost mode at game onset. Their decals also remain visible.
 -Rounded all metal cost values to the nearest 50, energy costs to nearest 100. Exceptions:
  -Walls/tank traps (left at 10/50)
  -Battle droids (rounded metal from 20 to 50)
 -Rebel military flag upgrades are now considerably cheaper and take 15s less time to upgrade. They are still more expensive than a barracks, but remember they also produce metal
 -Imperial military flag upgrades are also now cheaper and upgrade faster
 -Z-95 magpulse now has a flighttime of 10s (compared to whatever the default formula worked out to). It also does twice as much 'damage' as before
 -Non-vehicles (excluding rebcom) cannot be transported by enemy transports anymore. You can still pick up enemy vehicles
 -Flag econ upgrades now disable on energy stall
 -Air balance is completely revamped as discussed on the forums. It will need a lot of testing.
 Technical:
 -Droidekas now walk for 5s (with shields up) before folding up to roll, unless they are actively aiming and tweaked foldup anim
 -Removed Argh's droid deactivation script. I wouldn't call deactivating at +135/-15 with 900k storage working properly.
 -Bothan Canattack/canfight=0 (it has a dummy weapon for its stealing script to handle range)
 -Added ambient/animation sounds to: droid plant, both tibanna plants
 -Added new VAs for: Spotter tower, Imperial mobile artillery
 -Disabled all 'cant' acks
 -Factored down all build and worker times so 'buildtime' tags are all in seconds relative to factories and L1 construction droids for both sides. The Rebel Commander and proto construction droids are the only units which build at different rates
 -Fixed inverted triangles on Bothan model
 -Updated infantry.h library, now with idle animations and some minor re-posing and other updates
 -AT-RT pilot looks where he's going now
 -Tweaked Espo walk animation, though it still looks kind of bad. Also introduced a random sleep to remove the 'marching'
 -Renamed/reclassified Espo/AT-RT to the _w_ category now for walkers
 -Gave all units with secondary textures a blue channel (copied from green) to maintain status quo when the specularity shader patch is live
 Graphics:
 -New Imperial Droid plant skin by Zsinj
 -Added neutral flag hologram
 -New Rebel Repulsorlift plant skin by Zsinj
 -New Rebel Tank Trap (replaces sandbags) made from scaffolds (skin by Zsinj)
 -Updated ULAV secondary skin by Zsinj
 -Updated Espo skins
 -Added Z-95 secondary skin by Zsinj

Build 023
----------
 Balance:
 -Fixed Rebel APC mass and buildtime. I edited the wrong line, whoops.
 -Adjusted Imperial mobile artillery mass
 -Fixed LAAT/c being unable to load the mobile artillery
 -Fixed (increased) upgrade times for flag economic upgrades
 -Implemented auto flag placer gadget. Removed the ability to build flags.
 -Decreased flag capture radius from 200 to 125
 Technical:
 -Fixed SBD hitsphere and height
 -Edited hologram luarule script adding x/zshift values so holograms could be added properly to the various flag upgrades
 -Removed builder capabilities from sniper (leftover from its sapper days)
 -Fixed cob errors on imp commander anti-air upgrade
 -Added doesnotcount.lua gadget by KDR_11k. The gadget kills a player when all he has left are units with *.fbi\[customparams]\dontcount=1. Implemented on both L1 flags.
 -Fixed Imp/Reb APCs unloading. Not as spiffy anymore but they work right.
 -Fixed some cob stack errors
 -Re-added some missing 3do textures
 -Fixed rebel fusion corpse tdf file
 -Repulsorlifts now tilt properly over rough terrain
 -Added a death animation to the spotter tower
 -Updated armordefs.lua, fixed a couple typos, removed non-beta units, re-sorted unit lists
 -Fixed fake mex crash bug
 Graphics:
 -Added custom ground decal to rebel airplant
 -Added new CEGs:
  -Laser hit effects based on CEGs made for us by quantum,
  -Laser ground lighting effects also made for us by quantum,
  -Missile trails based on CEGs made by Pressure Line for S44
 -Removed engine flares from TIEs by complaint from Zsinj
 -New Repulsorlift lab model by Secure
 -Revised Imperial Ion cannon skin by Zsinj
 -New Imperial Theta-class dropship skin by Zsinj

 -Revised Imperial TIE crawler skin by Zsinj
 -Implemented preliminary round decals on flags to indicate the capture radius and also hide metal spots on the map
 -Removed old re-entry flame effects used by royal guard/sensor, replaced with new CEG

Build 022
----------
 Balance:
 -Decreased infantry slow-walk to run restore time from 3.5s to 0.5s
 -Infantry now capture while firing again due to new lua (see technical). Mael is looking into fixing this.
 -Changed protocon armor class from light_armor to no_armor and cut its HP by 65%
 -Increased reb_i_trooper hp from 80 to 95
 -Cut AT-RT damage against infantry/droids from 125 to 35, halved values against other armor
 -Custom death explosion for imp ground transport. Does only 50 damage to infantry, allowing them to survive its death
 -Made imp/reb_p_flag unreclaimable
 -Implemented Bothan resource stealing. When nearby an enemy holoflag (upgrades included), he will steal all of the resources generated by that flag. He must remain still to steal, and the holographic projection becomes heavily distorted when being stolen from
 -Upgraded flags will now produce the correct amount of metal depending on the map and such. This is roughly 3x a L1 flag currently.
 -L1 flags for both sides now produce and use the same amounts of metal/energy (the previous rebel values)
 -Royal Guards are no longer transportable
 -LAATs and Rebel shuttles use the land flood method. This unloads all troops when an area unload order is given
 -Decreased imp/reb_p_flag hitsphere size. Should make them less effective as walls.
 -Increased protocon brakerate from 0.3 to 3. Should reduce dumbass wandering
 -Doubled speed of basic Rebel aircraft laser cannon. A-Wings could nearly outrun their own lasers before
 -Dropped mineral makers and mineral storages for both sides. The old Rebel mineral storage model is now their Tibanna refinery.
 -Dropped TIE vanguard and made the TIE Droid the scout
 -Imperial APC now only carries 8 men or 800 mass, whichever comes first
 -Copied LAAT flight stats (accel, brakerate, etc) to V-wing to hopefully make it behave a bit better
 -Fixed holoflags being buildable underwater. They now have a maxwaterdepth of 10 (very shallow)
 -Changed Imperial APC movement class so it's no longer fully amphibious. Made the class it is now part of capable of deeper water depths (this only changes the Hailfire and APC).
 -Buildings are now unreclaimable. Maelstrom needs to code the 'Sell' function for them.
 -Removed the Rebel advanced barracks from buildmenus, and put the Bothan in the L1 Barracks. The Bothan can now call-in (build) 8-man commando squads anywhere, given enough time and resources.
 -Reclaiming is now performed gradually rather than in 'chunks,' meaning you receive the income for the duration of the process rather than all at once at the end.
 -Flanking bonus is now disabled game-wide
 -Added Economic upgrades for flags. These are a fork, the other being the existing military bunkers. They replace metal makers.
 -Increased Rebel Espo velocity from 1.11 to 2.0
 -All air units (including speeder bikes, STAP, protocon) now have collide=0
 -Imp mobile artillery and hailfire now have Area attack
 -Corpse req. returns are now in line with current req. values. "Full" corpses give 30%, then 20%, then 15%, and all rubble piles give 10%
 -Greatly increased brakerate of Reb commander and both construction droids in an attempt to stop them from blocking their own build positions
 Technical:
 -Converted all scripts to use linear constant 65536 instead of 163840. This properly matches up the linear scale between scripts and Spring/Upspring.
 -Fixed cob error in reb_i_rockettrooper
 -Imp ground transport now drops troops properly on death
 -Fixed crash bug on reb_p_estore corpse
 -Rescripted royal guard, it shouldn't lock up (visually) anymore and adjusted his standing pose so he's not hunched over strangely
 -Upgraded hologram lua scripts from Maelstrom
 -Bothan resource stealing lua from Maelstrom
 -Fake mex lua from Maelstrom. Now also stalls when energy stalls
 -Upgraded corpsetype luacob from Maelstrom
 -Revised rebel scaffold stuff so the scaffolds no longer appear in preview/ghost mode. They are also compatible with the .give command now.
 -Replaced flag capture weapon with lua from Maelstrom. Will no longer be hampered by targetting/collision/other weapon issues. Men cannot capture while they are firing.
 -Fixed reb commander and all construction droids' build animation crap
 -Made imp L1AA use new projectile firing system instead of slaved weapons
 -Converted cursor set to the new png/txt format
 -Increased reb_c_condroid size by 50%
 -Increased TIE crawler size by 50%
 -Desynced infantry run scripts once more by re-introducing a random sleep
 -Added Pushresistant=1 to reb_p_varenergy
 -New progress bar script by Maelstrom, used by squads right now but can be used by anything
 -Updated upgrade script by Maelstrom which refunds spent resources when an upgrade is cancelled with 'Stop'
 -Added modrules.tdf
 -Updated modinfo.tdf with new tags
 -Removed unused multiple "RESERVED_EFFECT" references from FBIs and scripts mod-wide
 -Added sws_gui.lua widget. It's inefficient and sloppy codewise right now, but it works. This widget:
  -loads a custom-generated ctrlpanel.txt file which forces square buildpics regardless of resolution or aspect ratio,
  -adds a custom formatted tooltip.
 -Added gui_resbar.lua widget. Replaces the original resource bars with our own. Needs better graphic files.
 -Fixed reb_i_sniper aiming pose. I think the script just needed recompiled. I didn't change anything.
 -New Droideka script. Probably buggy as hell.
 -Replaced armor.txt with gamedata/armordefs.lua including a small function shamelessly taken from CA
 -L1 flags are now truly invulnerable to all weapon fire since they are captured via lua now. Also scaled the flag HP to 100, and consequently scaled back the capture rate by the same ratio to make the health an accurate display of capture progress
 -Area attack luarule by KDR_11k added
 -Revised mobile unit masses mod-wide
 -Cleaned out sounds archive, removed unused and non-beta sounds.
 -Added new voice acks for: A-wing, TIE Bomber, Espo, Sniper
 -Converted all old play-sounds to new get PLAY_SOUND system. Construction units and such will no longer be audible to enemies unless they are in their LOS.
 -Added death animations to sniper

Build 021 fix
----------
Lua:
 - Fixed death_watch_defs.lua to use the correct flag names.

Build 021
----------
Technical:
 -Disabled imp_i_rockettrooper corpse, fixing missing 3do crash

Build 020
----------
 Balance:
 -Increased antiflag damage by ~25%
 -Flags can now only be captured while a unit's primary weapon is not active
 -Reb solar replaced by reb_p_varenergy, a mobile hovercraft energy producer. It produces 20 energy, and uses 10 energy while moving or over water. Hold position prevents it from moving and lets it produce +20 unimpeded unless over water.
 -Increased T2-B armor by 40%
 -Increased ULAV armor, speed and turnrate by 50%
 -Increased E-web burst from 10 to 15 bolts; increased damage by 20%
 -Removed antiflag from Flametrooper and rocket troopers (both sides)
 -Increased Flametrooper armor by 25%, damage by 25%, death explosion damage by 50%
 -Removed 1xRepeater, added 1xFlametrooper to Heavy squad
 -Gave Cloud Car a 4-burst laser with each bolt doing 45% less damage than before. Chill's suggestion
 -Increased reb_i_veterantrooper buildtime by 50%
 -Decreased imp/reb_d_antiair damage by 30%
 -Increased imp ground transport buildtime from 3000 to 5000, mass from 300 to 8000, hp from 600 to 1200
 -Set up imp flag upgrade bunker ability. Like the Rebel factory flag, the mex ability conflicts, necessitating lua and a steady 3.5 metal production for the time being.
 -Halved metal maker metal output, but not energy drain, to match previous scaling down of the flags' metal output
 -Cantbetransported added to royal guard (only applies to svn >= 4500)
 -Made all biological infantry unreclaimable. Vehicles with infantry can still be reclaimed
 -Halved probot damage, cut back HP from 60-->40
 -Switched TIE interceptor and TIE fighter speeds (13.5 and 13)
 -Increased TIE Vanguard health from 110 to 140 (will barely survive one imp rocket trooper rocket now)
 -Increased T-Wing health from 115 to 145 (will barely survive one imp rocket trooper rocket now)
 -Changed rebel anti-air trooper's anti-air damage from 135 to 50. Previously, each rocket was as effective as one imp rocket trooper, and it fired three per burst. Oops.
 -Removed fusion plant from imp_c_protocon menu
 -Removed Speeder bikes from vehicle/repulsorlift plants
 -Added air units to LANDAIR category. This will allow most units to fire at air.
 -Increased imp/reb_p_flag maxslope from 10 to 30
 -Increased reb_a_shuttle transportmass from 300 to 1000 and set transportsize from 3 to 1 (so it only picks up infantry)
 -Added reb_sc_speederbike to proper armor class (previous was none)
 -Added Scout trooper to proper armor class (previous was none)
 -Changed ULAV and CAV armor classes to light_armor (was heavy and medium)
 -Reconfigured Ion (paralyzer) weapons. No longer able to ever stun infantry (it may have been possible with AOE), reduced effectiveness so some things might take multiple shots again.
 -Removed imp_v_cav from buildmenu
 -Increased AT-RT buildtime from 3333 to 5000, hp from 290 to 430, metal cost from 187 to 250, decreased aoe from 32 to 8
 -Increased TIE crawler speed from 1.5 to 1.6, hp from 1200 to 1500, metal cost by 25%, halved reload time, cut damage by 66% against infantry and a bit more against other stuff (all values were prev. 90 dmg)
 -Increased TX-130 hp to 1050, metal cost from 533 to 690, dec. turnrate from 500 to 300, aoe from 64 to 16, reload time from 3 to 5
 Technical:
 -Put landspeeder in GROUND category, removed from VTOL
 -Scaled ULAV model down to 75% previous size
 -Scaled Cloud car model down to 75% previous size
 -Implemented Mael's lua script to allow proper animation of factory doors and the barracks shuttle
 -Fixed Turbolaser (which is stand-in flag upgrade) death bug and disabled its corpse
 -First version of the new universal infantry script library. Makes things easier to maintain, and now allows for complex death animations.
 -Fixed some non-beta typos/misplacements in armor.txt
 -Semi-fixed Eweb and MRB. They can no longer permanently deploy with hold position, and no longer feature the sidestep scripts. This should also fix the rare lockup they caused.
 -Deployed first four death animations to imp_i_flametrooper, reptrooper, scouttrooper, stormtrooper; first death animation to reb_i_trooper
 Graphics:
 -New reb solar replacement model (yet unskinned)

Build 019
----------
 Balance:
  -Increased reb_commander repeater damage by 10
 Technical:
  -Removed sweepfire from antiflag weapon, should fix occasional wrong direction when the flag is captured
  -canattackground=0 on antiflag weapon
  -Updated/new lua scripts:
   -E-Web upgrade on the imp_comm actually does stuff now
   -Feature clear script on imp_comm ran at beginning of game to clear features from footprint

Build 018
----------
 Balance:
  -Increased imp_b_barracks workertime from 90 to 160. Will hasten squad building at a higher resource drain.
  -Removed ANTIFLAG weapon from scout trooper. They can still build them, but not capture existing flags.
  -Increased range of imp/reb_i_rockettrooper from 550 to 750. Should allow them to hit more often. They still need LOS to use this range effectively.
  -Created custom MRB for rebcom. Fires half as many bolts, longer reload time, same damage.
  -Doubled T2B (four barreled one) range
  -Added reb_commander to IONTARGETABLE category
  -Increased scout trooper buildtime from 850 to 1050
  -Removed rocket trooper from reb_p_flagadv buildmenu
  -Removed Freerunner
  -Made imp flag upgrade a toned down Turbolaser turret
 Technical:
  -Added commander=1; to all the imp commanders and the reb commander. Whoops. Should fix comm death ends crash.
  -Added dotted line fx to antiflag weapon. Provides visual link to the capture process
  -Fixed missing semicolon in repeater trooper TDF which caused him to do nearly no damage
  -Fixed eweb unset texture crash bug
  -Fixed minor script bugs in TIE vanguard

Build 017
----------
 Balance:
  -Increased imp/reb_c_condroid costs by 30%
  -Increased repulsorlift/vehicle plant costs by 30%
  -Increased imp_b_vehicleplant build time by 50%; repulsorlift plant by 40%
  -Changed reb_p_flagadv to produce 3.9m on all maps so its factory function works. This is a stopgap, it needs mobilemex-type lua. Don't fucking abuse it.
 Technical:
  -Fixed weapons so they don't fire at holoflags. Some units (particularly aircraft) will still attempt to target them and aim/make runs; in the case of aircraft, this is an engine bug.
  -Increased size of aircraft radar icons from 1.5->1.9; air cons 2->2.4; transports 1.5->2.4
  -Increased reb_sp_spotter hitsphere size
 Graphics:
  -New imp_v_groundtransport s3o

  -Halved LAAT damage, gave it 25% more armor
  -Increased range of flag capture weapon by 33%
  -Reduced probot explosion AOE from 300 to 128
  -Increased commando speeds from 1.2 to 2 (avrocket 0.9 to 1.8)
 Technical:
  -Changed probot radar icon to special infantry
  -Enlarged SBD model
  -Added STAP to GROUND category. Should allow most land units to fire at it, not sure about their effectiveness.
  -Changed landspeeder to hovercraft. Halved its top speed too.
  -Changed flag radar icons to faction logos
  -Fixed A-Wing secondary texture filename and reapplied it
 Graphics:
  -Reduced size of holo beacon textures to 128x128, created glowmap, converted to dds

  -Implemented preliminary upgrade costs (in resources and time) to imp_commander and both flags
  -Reduced eweb damage by 25%
  -Reduced MRB damage by 33%
  -Reduced reb_i_trooper damage by 33%
  -Increased imp_d_antiair reload time from 0.25 to 0.4, reduced damage by 25%
  -Reduced reb_i_avrocket damage by 20%
  -Increased both anti air troopers' range to allow more reliable firing, and made both anti-air only again

  -Fixed reb_commander (needed canhover=1;)
  -Increased slope allowance for reb_commander's movement class.
  -Improved LAAT, LAAT/c flight code (honestly have no idea, basically just lowered their acceleration)
  -Fixed probot and landspeeder radars
  -Disabled the imp_b_barracks shuttle landing for now. Waiting on luacob interface to do it properly in relation to squads
  -Replaced swoop with rebel trooper on a speeder bike
 Model/skin/graphics stuff:
  -Added scaffolds to reb_sp_spotter
  -Added gun texture to imp_i_scouttrooper
  -Added reb_commander texture, scaled up its model
  -Added updated reb_p_estore texture
  -Updated imp_commander texture with new nazi flag texture
  -New Atgar model is present but not textured or buildable

Build 014
----------
 -imp_i_royalguard needs cantbetransported=1 (caught by Secure - engine needs patched first)
 -Attempted giving reb_p_flagadv infantry building capability. Failed: Factories can't be mexxes and vice versa. Will need lua to be possible.
 -First two death animations on imp_i_stormtrooper
 -Reentry effects for imp_i_royalguard
 -Revised scaffold+dust animations for rebel buildings currently using them
 -Imported, rigged, and scripted wrapped but yet untextured Rebel Commander model
 -imp_commander texture added
 -new imp_a_cloudcar model/texture added & scripted
 -Replaced old Speederbike scout trooper model/skin with AT-RT version
 -Created seperate Scout trooper unit for use with imp commander

Feb 18 2007
----------
 -Changed Energy/Metal balancing, for a less stall-prone gameplay.
 -Made Aircraft unable to Guard, so that exponential gameplay is slowed and impossible with Air (ala traditional OTA gameplay).
 -Wrote all new custom ExplosionGenerators for a lot of basic FX, including better smoke code and other improvements.
 -Built several new models, finished others, and cleaned up operations on many.
 -Added new flare FX for most units.
 -Rebalanced many SWTA units to fit more cleanly into the SWS overall gameplay.
 -Moved several items, including the Imperial Transport, to a lower Tech Level to promote their use, especially during early gameplay.
 -Rewrote the aircraft steering code for the vast majority of units that can fly.
 -Rewrote all Rebel weapons so that they fit the standards established during Imperial fix stage.
 -Rewrote all Rebel Units so that they fit the standards established during Imperial fix stage.
 -Outlined basic gameplan for the fix list, and established roadmap for future fixes.
 -Added reworked sounds by L0223R.  These still need fixes for occasional clipping issues.

Jul 31 2006
-----------
 Most units:
  -Nemo added "NOTINF" category to all non-infantry category, and made that cat the REBCMNDO's badtargetcategory. Now he will prefer firing on infantry rather than wasting shots on other targets.

Jul 30 2006
-----------
 Whole mod:
  -Cleaned .fbi files, restructured categories
 imp_d_AdvAA, imp_d_Artillery, imp_inf_EWEB, imp_d_IonCannon, imp_d_MissileTurret, imp_air_TIEBomber, imp_air_TIEFighter, imp_d_Turbolaser, rebaa, rebaaa, rebarty, reb_d_golan_turret, rebmrb:

  -Fixed corpse file typo

Jul 12 2006
-----------
 Lasers:
  -New models using onion effect
 Infantry:
  -New walk script, based on Benito's jedi run script. More of a jog, though.

 REB infnatry:
  -Scaled by 0.75 to match stormtrooper scale
 Movement classes:
  -Changed the following units from Walker3x3 to Walker2x2 (also adjusted footprints to match):
        imp_v_ATAR, imp_v_ATPT, REBATPT
  -Changed Walker2x2's crushstrength to 5, so not all walkers (and some bigger droids) can crush stuff
  -Changed Infantry1x1's crushstrength to 0.
  -Tank2x2 maxwaterdepth to 10
  -TANKHOVER2's maxslope to 15 (so heavier hovers can't climb steep hills--may need changed back)
  -New movement class, TANKHOVER3 (name due to engine restrictions). Contains ConDs and other light hovers, which can go up steeper hills now:
        imp_c_ConDroid, reb_c_ConDroid, imp_sc_Bike, REBSWOOP, REBLAND, REBULAV, imp_sc_ProbeDroid
  -Reduced following units from 3x3 footprints to 2x2:

  -Magtorp uses conc for now, needs distinct model

Jun 23 2006
-----------

 imp_p_Solar
  -Re-implemented floor energy output value. Needs balanced. For now, it will produce (0 to 20)+10 energy (effectively 10 to 30).
   I left some comments in the FBI to make this clear.
 REBSOLAR
  -Same as imp_p_Solar, except (0 to 25)+10 energy
 REBSPOTTER
  -Finished new model, skin, script(?). Needs corpse made.

 -Commented out imp_inf_CrabDroid buildmenu line
 -Sent package to Deathblane [http://taspring.clan-sy.com/phpbb/viewtopic.php?t=4506] so he may test our changes. Can't hurt.

Apr 12 2006
-----------
 -Finished B-Wing skin + script for new model
 -Fixed AA problem. All weapons which were anti-air only in OTA are now anti-air only again. The problem was the lack of "VTOL" in the Category tags of air units.

Mar 10 2006
-----------
 -Gave all non gunship aircraft with lasers aim scripts and 60 degree forward fire arcs, to allow actual aiming during dogfighting. Should increase performance
 -Increased cruisealts of Airspeeder, Cloudcar, LAAT, and Vwing
